# Brand Identity
This page discusses the resources used to make the brand for this web app.

## Color Palette

I literally got this from a [Coolors palette](https://coolors.co/palette/fffcf2-ccc5b9-403d39-252422-eb5e28) where it was on a list of popular picks. [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) is a free website for creating color palettes.

## Typography
All fonts were sourced for free from Google Fonts
